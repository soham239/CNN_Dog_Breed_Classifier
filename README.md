# CNN_Dog_Breed_Classifier
This project involves building of a convolutional network based classifier for dog breeds on image data. It starts from basics of CNN, to building a CNN model from scratch using keras and further uses transfer learning to use existing pre-trained models of the keras library to improve model accuracy.
